#Thermistor Library for Temperature Measurement

##Overview

This project implements a custom thermistor library for accurate temperature measurement using Arduino or similar microcontrollers. The library provides a simple interface to calculate temperature based on ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) readings from a thermistor circuit.

##Features

Easy-to-use Thermistor class
Support for different temperature units (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit)
Customizable thermistor parameters
Accurate temperature calculation using the Beta parameter model

##Library Structure

###The library consists of two main files:
  thermistor.h: Header file containing the Thermistor class declaration
  thermistor.cpp: Implementation file with the Thermistor class methods

##Customization

You can customize the thermistor parameters in the constructor to match your specific thermistor and circuit setup:
  Rref: Reference resistor value in ohms
  R0: Thermistor resistance at reference temperature (usually 25°C) in ohms
  Beta: Beta coefficient of the thermistor
  samplingBitsNumber: ADC resolution (default 10 bits for most Arduino boards)
  Vcc: Supply voltage (default 5V)
  T0: Reference temperature in Kelvin (default 298.15K, which is 25°C)
